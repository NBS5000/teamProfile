## <span style="color:green"> The Task</span>

The task was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Additionally, the module must include a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test, these should be run by entering <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">npm run test</span>.

**SITUATION**

The provided user story was:

  * *Favicon designed and added*
* Javascript
  * *Error free performance*
  * *Multiple functions to separate aspects of code*
  * *Thorough comments*
* GIT

  * *Team members reordered to seniority level: Manager > Engineer > Intern*
  * *HTML generated*

* ~~GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input~~
* ~~WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information~~
* ~~THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input~~
* ~~WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML~~
* ~~THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address~~
* ~~WHEN I click on the GitHub username~~
* ~~THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab~~
* ~~WHEN I start the application~~
* ~~THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number~~
* ~~WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number~~
* ~~THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team~~
* ~~WHEN I select the engineer option~~
* ~~THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu~~
* ~~WHEN I select the intern option~~
* ~~THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu~~
* ~~WHEN I decide to finish building my team~~
* ~~THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated~~
* ~~WHEN I run <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">npm run test</span>~~
* ~~THEN Jest will be used to run a suite of tests on each module of the application~~
* ~~WHEN the suite of tests are run~~
* ~~THEN there are no fails or errors~~
